# Follower-Maze

## Getting Started

Run the application via sbt run.

## Architecture

### Actors 101

There are several functional approaches to allow concurrent computing in a safe manner; this implementation is based on the Actor model.
The main idea here is to subdivide the given problem into logical computing units/components and only allow communication
via messages. The actors are also able to inter-communicate. The interesting point: Actors are actually allowed to hold stateful values.
Theses values are strongly protected from direct access. From a design/architecture perspective this allows to have a better abstraction of
the domain entities compared traditional programs which also take care for the low-level threading concerns.

## The Solution
This solution consists of a small family of Actors: ClientsActor, EventSourceActor and MessageDispatcherActor.
Besides these main actors there are ad-hoc Actors existing for every incoming Client registration, i.e.
every open socket connection and the dispatching of events to the clients is handled inside a dedicated actor instance (i.e new thread).

- ClientsActor is responsible for receiving and informing the MessageDispatcherActor about new client connections
- EventSourceActors reads in all the transferred and unordered event messages from the given follower-maze socket server and re-routes
them ordered via the seqId to the MessageDispatcherActor
- MessageDispatcherActor re-routes all received messages in the correct order to the awaiting clients
